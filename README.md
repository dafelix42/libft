# libft
An implementation of functions in C.
We could only use malloc, free and write functions.
Also string.h was allowed to have access of the constant NULL.

# Part 1 - Fonctions de la libc

I had to rewrite all the functions below without using 

• memset
• bzero
• memcpy 
• memccpy 
• memmove 
• memchr 
• memcmp 
• strlen 
• strdup 
• strcpy 
• strncpy 
• strcat 
• strncat 
• strlcat 
• strchr 
• strrchr 
• strstr 
• strnstr 
• strcmp 
• strncmp 
• atoi
• isalpha 
• isdigit 
• isalnum 
• isascii 
• isprint 
• toupper 
• tolower

# Part 2 - Fonctions supplémentaires

In this second part, I had to code some extra functions that are not included in the libc. This functions can have a utility to help coding some function of the 1st part.
The purpose of this functions can be fund in the subject_libft.pdf
